# Config file for mosquitto

# See mosquitto.conf(5) for more information.
# =================================================================
# General configuration
# =================================================================

# Each client needs an ID
allow_zero_length_clientid false

# Set the maximum QoS supported. Clients publishing at a QoS higher than
# specified here will be disconnected.
# 4 Way Handshake would be a waste of bandwidth?
max_qos 1

# =================================================================
# Listeners
# =================================================================
# Listen on a port/ip address combination. By using this variable
# multiple times, mosquitto can listen on more than one port. If
# this variable is used and neither bind_address nor port given,
# then the default listener will not be started.
# The port number to listen on must be given. Optionally, an ip
# address or host name may be supplied as a second argument. In
# this case, mosquitto will attempt to bind the listener to that
# address and so restrict access to the associated network and
# interface. By default, mosquitto will listen on all interfaces.
# Note that for a websockets listener it is not possible to bind to a host
# name.
#
# The Standard Unencrypted port is 1883 and encrypted is 8883
# listener port-number [ip address/host name/unix socket path]
listener 1883
#
# To limit the Maximum ammount of connection (upto 1024) -1 = infinity
max_connections -1
#
# Choose the protocol to use when listening (mqtt or websocket)
protocol mqtt
 
# =================================================================
# Persistence
# =================================================================

# If persistence is enabled, save the in-memory database to disk
# every autosave_interval seconds.
autosave_interval 1800
#
# If true, mosquitto will count the number of subscription changes, retained
# messages received and queued messages and if the total exceeds
# autosave_interval then the in-memory database will be saved to disk.
# If false, mosquitto will save the in-memory database to disk by treating
# autosave_interval as a time in seconds.
autosave_on_changes false
#
# Save persistent message data to disk (true/false).
persistence false
# The filename to use for the persistent database, not including
# the path.
persistence_file mosquitto.db

# Location for persistent database.
# Default is an empty string (current directory).
# Set to e.g. /var/lib/mosquitto if running as a proper service on Linux or
# similar.
#persistence_location

# Logging
# =================================================================

# Places to log to. Use multiple log_dest lines for multiple
# logging destinations.
# Possible destinations are: stdout stderr syslog topic file dlt

#log_dest file C:/programming/mosquitto.log

# If set, only clients that have a matching prefix on their
# clientid will be allowed to connect to the broker. By default,
# all clients may connect.
